```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 4, fig.align = "center")
```


My collaborators for this lab were: 

## Part I

### 1.

There is my answer to the first question.

### 2.

Here is my answer to the second question, which will include an image if you upload one, be sure its in the file directory next this file, change `file-name.png` to the name of your file, and remove the `#` that leads that line of R code.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("file-name.png")
```

## Part II

### 3.

Here is an example of an R chunk.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
